# Instructions on How to Run the files
**NOTE: npm and node should be installed on the machine**
- Start by installing the node_modules that will be needed to run the client and server.
- **Inside client_files directory**
  - Run `npm install`
- **Inside server_files directory**
  - Run `npm install`
  - Then run `node server.js`
- **Inside client_files directory**
  - Run `npm start`

Running `npm start` should open up your browser automatically. If browser does not open, then navigate to _http://localhost:3000_
Here you can input any code in the upper textbox. Clicking "run", should print a message in the lower textbox saying that the code has been received.
Inside your **server_files** directory, a **code_to_compile.txt** that contains the typed code in a json format should have been created.
