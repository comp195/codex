# Project Description
We are programming a web application that would allow users to collaborate with friends and 
use the live editing feature inside a compiler and make coding easier when done in group.
Basically, this web application would allow multiple users to write, edit and compile a programming 
language together at the same time. The application would use timeline feature and compile the last edited code in the timeline.
