# Project Description
We are programming a web application that would allow users to collaborate with friends and 
use the live editing feature inside a compiler and make coding easier when done in group.
Basically, this web application would allow multiple users to write, edit and compile a programming 
language together at the same time. The application would use timeline feature and compile the last edited code in the timeline.

# Project Components
1. Nginx Web Server
2. 3rd Party compiler/interpreter
3. AWS Cloud Network
4. Ubuntu Command Line interface

# Languages
1. Node.js
2. React
3. HTML

# Current Progress
We have a simple basic layout ready in React that would work as the testing variable for the back end (Node.js) system implementation which includes the multi-sharing editing, compiling and producing the output, deploy the system on webserver.
